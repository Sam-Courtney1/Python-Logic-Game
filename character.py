This module defines the Character, NPC, Suspect, and Witness classes for characters in a crime investigation game.

Author: Haydens Little Helpers
Date: 18/11/2023

Description: - The Character class serves as the base class, providing
common attributes and methods for characters. - The Suspect and Witness
classes are subclasses that inherit from Character and introduce their
unique attributes and methods. - The NPC class represents non-player
characters with general interactions. - The Suspect class represents
characters under suspicion in the crime investigation, providing alibis and
potential deception cues. - The Witness class represents characters who have
witnessed or heard something related to the crime, sharing observations.

Classes:
    - Character: Base class with common attributes and methods for characters.
    - NPC: Non-player character class inheriting from Character.
    - Suspect: Represents characters under suspicion with alibi information.
    - Witness: Represents characters who have witnessed or heard something related to the crime.
